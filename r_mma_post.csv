[Francis Ngannou](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3362/francis-ngannou) is working with some heavy hitters ahead of his first heavyweight title defense in January.

On Wednesday, Ngannou‚Äôs head coach Eric Nicksick released a photo on Instagram showing the UFC heavyweight champion ‚Äî who is preparing to defend against former teammate [Ciryl Gane](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5037/ciryl-gane) in the main event of UFC 270 on Jan. 22 ‚Äî and GLORY heavyweight titleholder Rico Verhoeven together at Xtreme Couture.

[https://www.instagram.com/francisngannou/?utm\_source=ig\_embed&amp;ig\_rid=79b8b257-f861-402f-8e3d-2738a2fdda8c](https://www.instagram.com/francisngannou/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=79b8b257-f861-402f-8e3d-2738a2fdda8c)

 

MMA Fighting reached out to Nicksick who provided some context about how the pairing came together.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing too crazy,‚Äù Nicksick told MMA Fighting. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve hit him up a few times about working for camps but schedules never really meshed. He was out in \[Los Angeles\] for a couple of weeks, he‚Äôs gonna be out here for a week.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try to get him back out here mid-camp, and then again at the tail end.‚Äù

Verhoeven is coming off of a hard fought fourth-round TKO win over Jamal Ben Saddik at October‚Äôs GLORY Collision 3 event where Verhoeven suffered a gruesome eye [injury](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVcbMQltdSo/) ‚Äî to the point where his phone no longer recognized him ‚Äî and is still recovering, so he isn‚Äôt able to spar with Ngannou. The hope is that over the next couple of months, Verhoeven and Ngannou will work more closely ahead of the unification bout between Ngannou and Gane.

Ngannou captured the title with a second-round KO win over [Stipe Miocic](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/775/stipe-miocic) at [UFC 260](https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1186/ufc-260) in March",0.75,2.0,t3_qx7iyp,,

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Hand trapping is something which I'm curious to see more of in mma. With Queensberry Rules style of boxing and kickboxing/muaythai the defences taught would be less effective without the gloves. With theory's   of Wing Chun practitioners interacted with  Western fighters bare knuckle fighters.

I knew with Chinese martial arts there's a lot of bs surrounding it. With China using it as a propaganda and protecting the bs. History with Chinese martial arts for long period with the wing dynasty martial arts were banned so that to supreas upraising. Therefore I believe all.martial arts were kept in the shoalin temples but some were burned down. Also a lot of the Chinese martial arts being washed down to choreography. 

Just from my observation. Could be more done with open hand striking in mma. With defence. Obviously old school bare knuckle would be a good example. But bare knuckle today is just a gore fest with little skill. Well in america at least.",0.76,56.0,t3_qpnkgu,,

MMA,Does Yair have a realistic chance to beat Max?,"I've only seen the last 3-4 fights from Yair, and from what I've seen I feel like he's maybe being overhyped a little. I know most people think Max will beat him, but I'm still confused how he's even in the top 5 at this point. 


1. He decisioned Jeremy Stephens 2 years ago - he did look really good, and almost/should have finished Stephens early on, but then he got wrestlefucked for an entire round. His ground and pound/finishing was abysmal. 


2. He was losing a competitive fight to the Zombie before his ""let's hug it out"" shenanigans, and then got a crazy last second KO. From what I remember of the fight, I would probably give Zombie 3-4 rounds. Reminds me a little bit of the Volkov/Lewis fight - not as one-sided, but still a clear ""come from behind"" win. 


3. That takes us all the way back to 2017 (the lack of fights is concerning as well). In 2017, he got beaten by a pretty old Frankie Edgar, and beat the corpse of BJ Penn. Neither is a very good feather in the cap. 


4. In 2016, he beat two ""prospects"" - Caceres and Fili are both fun, game fighters, but neither is even really a top-15 type guy. I can't remember - were either of them ranked at the time? 


Maybe I'm piling on, since he's already the underdog - but I just don't really get it. Am I missing some important context? Is it because he's flashy? Is it because he's still pretty young? Or is he severely overrated?",0.93,440.0,t3_qplqlq,,

&gt;**NO SPOILERS IN THIS THREAD**",0.84,18.0,t3_qoj8l5,,
MMA,LET'S PLAY MATCHMAKER: UFC 268,"New York lived up to the moniker of ""Wet Dream Tomato"" because holy hell there was a lot of blood tonight. UFC 268 marked back to back pivotal cards for the promotion, as the promotions return to NYC came just one week after the UFC's giant card in the UAE. There were three huge debuts, arguably the greatest 3 round fight in UFC history, and two statements made by the reigning champions. So let's make some fights after the 2nd last main card of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

SPEED ROUND

&amp;#x200B;

* Ode Osbourne did enough work to get the job done. Him and Jeff Molina would make a good fight.
* Melsik Baghdasaryan has promising fight IQ. He should face fellow high-rate finisher Kamuela Kirk
* Dustin Jacoby is 6-0-1 in his last 7. He put in a great performance coming in on 4 days notice. A fight with Ryan Spann makes sense.
* Chris Barnett is absolutely wild to watch. Make a fight against either Jarjis Danho, or Carlos Felipe.
* Ian Garry is the new Irish face of the UFC. Put him against Khabib's cousin Abubakar Nurmagomedov.
* Nassourdine Imavov is the premiere French middleweight for the UFC. Give him a test against the winner of Brad Tavares-Brendan Allen, or even Sean Strickland. Either one would be a damn banger.
* Welcome to the UFC, Chris Curtis. Maybe a fight with Deron Winn or Julian Marquez will be a good next step for the former PFL star.
* Bobby Green is a legitimate challenge at 155. He should fight for the rankings against #11 Diego Ferreira.
* Shane Burgos re-enters the win column. A fight with Alex Caceres makes sense.
* Marlon Vera has finally broken into the top 10. He should face the winner of Munhoz-Cruz.

THE BIG ONES

&amp;#x200B;

* Alex Pereira vs Andreas Michailidis

RESULT: Alex Pereira defeats Andreas Michailidis in Round 2 via TKO

Alex Pereira: Winner of Bruno Silva-Jordan Wright

One of the greatest kickboxers of all time has now arrived in the UFC. Former Glory Kickboxing champion Alex Pereira showed us exactly what he is capable of at this point in his MMA career with his surreal knockout power, and an overall striking skillset which is probably already top 5 in all of the middleweight division. At 34 years of age, Alex Pereira isn't going to be here for a long time, but rather a good time, and he'll probably get a big push up the 185 ladder. I think a fight with the winner of Bruno Silva-Jordan Wright is the appropriate next move for middleweight's newest star. Both Silva and Wright have lots of knockouts in their careers, and either man's skillset will be challenging for Pereira.

&amp;#x200B;

* \#2 Justin Gaethje vs Michael Chandler

RESULT: Justin Gaethje defeats Michael Chandler via unanimous decision (somehow)

Justin Gaethje: Winner of Oliveira-Poirier

Yeah that's definitely the fight of the year. Gaethje-Chandler lived up to every ounce of the hype, as both fighters had each other on the ropes on multiple occasions. That might be the greatest three round fight in UFC history. It was one of the most glorious slugfests I have ever seen. Justin Gaethje is back in the win column with this impressive win, and it's very likely he will be fighting for a world title once again. Considering that Justin overcome every challenge in emphatic fashion since James Vick in 2018 (minus Khabib), It's safe to say that Gaethje's latest triumph was enough to get him another title fight against the winner of UFC 269's main event.

&amp;#x200B;

Michael Chandler: Winner of Riddell-Fiziev, or Rafael dos Anjos.

Former Bellator champion Michael Chandler pushed Justin Gaethje to the brink in his third UFC appearance. At 35 years of age, Michael Chandler's next step is very important for his tenure in MMA's premiere promotion. He even said himself that he's not here for a long time, he's here for a good time. So if there's any hope for Chandler getting another title shot, then he 100% has to win his next matchup. So check this out: How about we get Michael Chandler to face the winner of the highly anticipated fight between Brad Riddell, and Rafael Fiziev. That fight should be a banger, and personally I would really love to see it go down sometime in the Summer of 2022. If that is not a viable option, then give Chandler perhaps the more realistic option in Rafael Dos Anjos. RDA is currently recovering from an arthroscopic knee surgery which he went under two months ago, so it's not clear when he'll be able to return to action. Maybe him and Chandler can both come back at top shape sometime next year, and headline a fight night.

&amp;#x200B;

* Rose Namajunas vs Zhang Weili II

RESULT: Rose Namajunas defeats Zhang Weili via split decision

Rose Namajunas: Carla Esparza II or Jessica Andrade III

And Still. Rose Namajunas' 2nd bout with Zhang Weili went much longer than the first, and while there were some issues, Rose still did enough to get her first title defense of her 2nd title reign. While Rose was doing a great job in outscoring Weili, her takedown defense is a bit iffy, so she'll need to strengthen it ahead of her 2nd title defense. That defense could come against wrestler Carla Esparza, or longtime competitive rival Jessica Andrade. Carla has done enough to get her shot at this point, and while I think this is the most likely option for title defense #2, it's not hard to rule out a trilogy fight with Jessica Andrade. The Brazilian recently won a flyweight bout against Cynthia Calvillo just six months after losing her title fight against Valentina Shevchenko. It's up to you fans, do you want the Rose-Carla rematch, or the trilogy between Rose and Andrade.

&amp;#x200B;

Zhang Weili: Marina Rodriguez

Magnum Weili showed noticeable improvements during her rematch with Thug Rose, but unfortunately, she's now down 2-0 against the current champion. However, just because she's down by two, does not mean this rivalry is anywhere close to being done. Zhang should attempt a bounce back against the surging Brazilian contender Marina Rodriguez, who has been on fire over the last year. Zhang-Rodriguez would be a brutal clinch battle, and it would make a good test for the stellar Rodriguez who has outclassed several opponents in her career. Make this fight for sometime in Spring-Summer 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

* Kamaru Usman vs Colby Covington II

RESULT: Kamaru Usman defeats Colby Covington via unanimous decision

Kamaru Usman: Leon Edwards or Vicente Luque

How about that wholesome moment at the end of the fight. Can we talk about that? Wasn't that amazing? It definitely was. Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington paid each other respect after another long back-and-forth which stunningly incorporated wrestling. Kamaru Usman is the clear fighter of the year for 2021, and he's also the pound for pound #1 fighter ahead of several giant names. Kamaru bested his arch rival Colby Covington, outworking him in a more calculated version of the first fight. Perhaps it's finally time for Leon Edwards to break through and at last get his title shot. That is if he beats his rival Jorge Masvidal in December. If Leon wins that, then holy fucking shit, just give him a damn title shot already. However, if Masvidal wins, then Vicente Luque is probably next in line for Kamaru Usman.

&amp;#x200B;

Colby Covington: Gilbert Burns, Jorge Masvidal, Vicente Luque, Leon Edwards, or fuck it, just put Khamzat Chimaev in there

Colby Covington showed clear improvements in his rematch with Kamaru Usman, and it's obvious that he is the best welterweight on planet earth besides Kamaru Usman. Colby once again pushed Kamaru Usman to the limit, showing off impressive head movement, and a sneaky uppercut. In my opinion, there's just so many options for Colby. Do you give him Gilbert, Luque, Leon if he loses, the viral sensation Khamzat Chimaev, or someone else. Khamzat's push here may be two much, but I would really love to see how he handles Colby. But obviously, the biggest fight is Jorge Masvidal. These two dislike each other like you wouldn't believe, and plus this fight has been brewing for some time now. Welterweight is a super talented division, and I can't wait to see what happens here.

I took a sports economics class, and I never once watched Moneyball, anyways I was intrigued by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and competitive balance.  I haven't included the most recent title fights from UFC 267.

While not 100% scientific below are the rankings of UFC Champions in their respective divisions.  Based on the 321 title fights between all current divisions of the UFC to determine which were the most competitive and highly concentrated divisions in the UFC.

0-1500 is Competitive

1500-2500 is Moderately Concentrated

2500-10000 is Highly Concentrated

All the Women‚Äôs divisions are highly concentrated.  Which is typical since they‚Äôre the newest divisions in the UFC.  Nunes and Cyborg hold 42.8% of wins in the Featherweight division. Nunes and Rousey holding 42.8% of wins in the Bantamweight division.  Shevchenko holding a whopping 87.5% of wins in the Flyweight division.  Lastly Jedrzejczyk holding 46.1% of wins in the Strawweight division.  Men‚Äôs Flyweight and Featherweight are highly concentrated with Johnson holding 67% of Flyweight victories and Jose Aldo holding 44.4% of all victories at Featherweight.

Woman's Strawweight: Joanna Jedrzejczyk HHI: 3017 % of Wins : 46.1

Woman's Flyweight: Valentina Shevchenko HHI: 7812 % of Wins :  87.5

Woman's Bantamweight: Nunes/Rousey HHI: 3775 % of Wins : 42.8

MMA,Ranking Discussion - Factoring Dominance of wins,"Recently Giga Chad mentioned a gripe after his dominating win over Edson Barboza, where he was only awarded his opponents spot in the rankings rather than elevating beyond that point for clearly dominating and finishing the fight.

Yesterday we saw Islam and Khamzat absolutely dominate #6 (Hooker) and #11 (Li Jingliang) in their respective divisions.

I believe that accounting for the dominance of these wins, it would make more sense in the modern ranking system to award Islam #2 in his division and Khamzat #5.

This is a more subjective approach than the classic ""Win a fight, take the spot"" method - But it's also more accurate.  As Islam would be a huge favorite over everyone ranked #3 and below and Khamzat would be a large favorite over everyone ranked #6 and below. With public and professional being so high on both and the quality of their recent wins, I think this is more fair.

I don't think this will become common place since talents like Giga, Islam, and Khamzat are rather rare as is this level of dominance. Curious your guys thoughts.  


Edit: Another thing to factor is the people being jumped. For example. Jorge Masvidal has no wins over fighters that currently currently ranked in top 15 of WW, yet he has three losses to people in the top 15.  


Stephen Thompson has only 1 win the last the last two years, though it is a substantial win over Vincente Luque.

MMA,What's a good matchup for Costa at 205?,"So if Dana gets his way Paulo Costa is moving up to Light Heavyweight from now on. What's the right matchup for him at this weight?

Everybody in the Top 5 besides maybe Thiago Santos should only be fighting other elite guys in the division so they are out of the question. After that there is Dominick Reyes but he's taken so much brain damage and is on a 3 fight losing streak, he should really get an easy fight next otherwise he might get cut. Magomed Ankalaev is going all the way up and will probably no. 5 or 6 when the rankings are updated.

So that leaves Volkan Oezdemir, I think this is the best fight for Costa to take. Oezdemir has lost 5 of his last 7 so he shouldn't get another high ranked opponent. Oezdemir while he still has a reach advantage against Costa, 75 &gt; 72, it's not nearly as much as other contenders and he's one of the smaller guys in the division. Plus they both just fought in the last week so the schedule should work out.",0.94,225.0,t3_qk1223,,
MMA,The Best Active Male MMA Strikers,"Give me your lists, and be sure to tell me how much of a casual I am ;)

[Based on their resume, performances, level of success/dominance, and technique.]

Honorable Mentions: *Kattar, Riddell, Ngannou, Usman, Askarov, Masvidal, O‚ÄôMalley, Burgos, Emmett, Tsarukyan, Shahbazyian, Reyes, Hooker, Mousasi, &amp;amp; Costa.*

„âï **Arnold Allen:** I think Allen is one of the most underrated Fighters/Strikers in the Sport. He has great Movement, great Boxing, he‚Äôs illusive, and he‚Äôs got some power to go along with all of that. 

„âî **Giga Chikadze:** In the near future, I think Chikadze could end up being much higher on a list like this, but I still feel like there hasn‚Äôt been enough from him to definitively *prove* that he‚Äôs one of the Elite Strikers in MMA‚Äîdespite having a background of Elite Striking. I think he has some of the best kicks on the Roster; I‚Äôm just curious to see how he does against someone like Holloway or Volk; because, even though Barboza is a Great Striker, he‚Äôs never really been ‚Äúunbeatable‚Äù or impossible to outstrike. So, I‚Äôd like to see how Giga does against some other Great Strikers that have been tougher to beat. 

„âì **Tom Aspinall:** Tom is another Fighter that I wanted to put much higher because of how-obviously-great-his Striking is; But I Feel like he just needs one or two more Fights against legit opponents to solidify himself as an Elite MMA Striker. But from what we‚Äôve seen from him so far, he looks like he‚Äôs bound to be one of Greatest Strikers in the Sport. He is without question, one of the Best Boxers. 

„âí **Ji≈ô√≠ Proch√°zka:** Jiri is one of those Strikers that doesn‚Äôt really utilize ‚Äúperfect technique‚Äù, but he is so successful and effective‚Äîso consistently, that I think he has to be considered an Elite Striker. I thought about including Ngannou because of his effectiveness along with the improvements he‚Äôs made‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt know if I would consider him as an Elite Striker because we don‚Äôt know if he would be as consistent‚Äîif he wasn‚Äôt at HW. 

„âë **Aleksandar Rakiƒá:** Another extremely underrated Striker/Fighter. Rakic has All-Around excellent Striking, great Hands, and he‚Äôs also got power. 

‚íõ **Rafael Fiziev:** One of the most talented/technical Strikers in the Sport. Amazing kicks, amazing head movement, great Boxing, good power ‚Ä¶ He has an insane amount of potential; He occasionally gets a little too emotional and gets caught, but if he can fix that and keep improving, he‚Äôll definitely be one of the best Strikers in the Sport. 

‚íö **Magomed Ankalaev:** Great hands, great kicks, great jab, great cross, great hook, fast, smart, powerful ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs a beast. 

‚íô **Leon Edwards:** Absolutely *Beautiful* Technique. Amazing all around Striker, possibly the best elbows in MMA, great defense ‚Ä¶ If he‚Äôs able to outstrike Masvidal‚ÄîHe might deserve to be higher. 

‚íò **Deiveson Figueiredo:** Figgy is almost like the Flyweight version Ngannou, except he‚Äôs a little better technically and doesn‚Äôt require as much energy to deliver the kind of power he generates. I think Figgy just needs to find a happy medium between how we fought in his first fight with Moreno‚Äîbut with a little better defense. 

‚íó **Justin Gaethje:** He put the worst beating, on the toughest guy ever‚Äîfinding a way to absolutely destroy Tony Ferguson. Amazing left hook, amazing kicks, amazing counters, timing, power ‚Ä¶

‚íñ **T.J. Dillashaw:** A few years ago, I would‚Äôve had him much higher, but as of now, it looks like he‚Äôs lost a little bit. Even still, he has absolutely fantastic Striking, that is extremely effective, and just as beautiful to watch. 

‚íï **Rob Font:** Excellent Boxing, excellent jab, and a lot of power for a 135er. He dominated Garbrandt and Moraes, two of the better Strikers at BW, fairly easily.  

‚íî **Brandon Moreno:** BMO might be the fastest guy in the sport right now. His Boxing and his Kicks are insanely fast, and they‚Äôre also extremely accurate. He also has a deceiving amount of Power. He rocked Figueirdo a few times‚Äîin a way that Figgy never rocked him. Just an excellent all around striker, with great Boxing and a great Jab. 

‚íì **Jan B≈Çachowicz:** He probably outstruck Izzy. He dominated Reyes after he (should‚Äôve) beat Jones. He KOd Rockhold and Anderson. He‚Äôs super intelligent, and he has insane power. 

‚íí **Jos√© Aldo:** Despite what people say, Aldo is not anywhere near ‚Äúwashed up‚Äù, and in fact, his boxing looked better than it ever has, in his last fight. 

‚íë **Max Holloway:** Volume. Volume. Volume. He may not have the best defense, but his offense is hard to beat. 

‚íê **Stephen Thompson:** Wonderboy probably would‚Äôve been higher a few years ago, I just think he‚Äôs no longer in his prime. But still, obviously, he‚Äôs an amazing Striker. 

‚íè **Cory Sandhagen:** Excellent movement/footwork/angles, beautiful boxing, great volume, diversity, and he seemed to have enough power to stun Dillashaw‚Äîquite a few times. 

‚íé **Robert Whittaker:** His striking is like ‚ÄòPoetry in motion‚Äô. Arguably, THE most Beautiful Striking in the sport. Extremely illusive, extremely intelligent, one of the best jabs in the sport, excellent counters, amazing/tricky combos, as well as good power. 

‚íç **Conor McGregor:** He might deserve to be higher on this list, but he also might deserve to be much lower. I‚Äôm not quite sure. His striking in the second fight with Poirier was excellent; He was easily winning on the feet‚Äîuntil he wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ He looked good in the third fight with Poirier‚Äîuntil he didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶  
But, he‚Äôs still‚Äîalmost certainly, an Elite Striker despite having lost his last two. 

‚ìπ **Dustin Poirier:** A brilliant, technical, and very intelligent Brawler. His boxing is excellent, but I think  his intelligence is what makes his Striking so Great.  
He destroyed Holloway (No, I do not think that fight was ‚Äúclose‚Äù), TKOd Conor 2x, TKOd Gaethje, TKOd Alvarez, and beat Hooker (another great striker). 

‚ì∏ **Ciryl Gane:** Outstanding in every way. Excellent movement, one of the best jabs and possibly-the best defense in the sport, extremely intelligent, legit power, GIGANTIC kicks, great cardio ‚Ä¶ Imho probably the Best Heavyweight Striker of All Time, despite the greatness of Cro Cop and Reem. 

‚ì∑ **Alex Volkanovski:** THE Best Jab in all of MMA. Possibly the best movement, one of the best Boxers in the sport, extremely intelligent, limitless cardio, power, accurate, some of the best feints in the game‚ÄîJust absolutely brilliant and beautiful striking, in every way. 

‚ì∂ **Israel Adesanya:** *The Most Talented Striker in the History of MMA.* Possibly, the most intelligent Striker ever. And Absolutely incredible Technical kickboxing. As far as pure talent/technique ‚Äî Nobody touches Izzy. 

But ‚Äî Imho ‚Ä¶

‚ìµ **Petr Yan:** THE *‚ÄùBest‚Äù, *most dominant, most successful Striker in MMA.*  
THE Best Boxer, one of the best defenses, incredible footwork/movement, insane power, extremely intelligent, ‚Ä¶ he has it all, and more, and on top of all that ‚Äî His striking is absolutely Beautiful. 
 
The top Two are really tricky, but this was my thought process: Izzy is clearly the most talented/technical ‚Äúall-around Striker‚Äù to ever compete in MMA. However, I think you can argue that Izzy has not been as ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù/‚Äúdominant‚Äù as other Elite Strikers in MMA.  
Izzy‚Äôs performance against Costa was one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen. His performance against Whittaker‚Äîalthough not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, was still excellent. And that was against one of the best Strikers in MMA.  
But, besides those two fights, Izzy has not been as dominant with his Striking, as you would expect him to be.  
**Vs. Vettori:** I think Izzy clearly won, but I definitely don‚Äôt think his Striking was dominant. He basically won the fight by landing a couple good leg kicks each round. He showed some great head movement, and had some decent shots, but not many more than Vettori.  
**Vs. Kelvin:** The fight was extremely close until the end, Kelvin won/outstruck Izzy 2/5 rounds, and he legitimately hurt Izzy a few times. But, to be fair‚ÄîKelvin was a great (and very underrated) Striker.  
**Vs Romero:** I still think that there‚Äôs a very strong chance that Yoel actually won that fight. He clearly won at least two rounds‚Äîwhere he landed BIG shots, whereas Izzy didn‚Äôt really do much *significant* damage, and only really had decent success with leg kicks. Whether or not Izzy won the 5th‚Äîis not really what matters to me; The point is that Izzy clearly didn‚Äôt have a dominant Striking performance against Romero.  
**Vs Blachowicz:** The first 3 Rounds, especially 1+2, were absolutely Razor thin. I think Izzy won the 3rd, and you could maybe make an argument that he won the first and/or the second as well, but I tend to lean towards Jan winning the first two. So, again, regardless of who actually won those rounds ‚Äî Izzy definitely did not have a dominant Striking performance. 

Now compare Izzy‚Äôs Resume/Performances to Petr Yan‚Äôs: 

**Vs Aldo:** Yan easily won the First (it was even close to being a 10-8 for Yan), Aldo probably won the 2nd, Aldo *may* have won the 3rd, and Yan absolutely dominated the 4th and 5th. Yan may have lost two rounds, but he didn‚Äôt really take a lot of damage‚Äîit seemed like he was trying to focus on getting reads on Aldo and trying to get him tired‚Äîbecause he basically just lost those rounds because of less activity. Obviously, Aldo is a phenomenal Striker.  
**Vs Sterling:** I know people thought this Fight was close, but if you go back and watch it a few times‚Äîit really wasn‚Äôt that close. Sterling landed two knees in the first, and he had two possibly-decent head kicks in the fourth-that were *at least* partially blocked ‚Ä¶ But other than that‚ÄîAljo basically did not land a single significant strike‚Äîapart from a few ‚Äúdecent‚Äù leg kicks and punches to the body. Every one of the significant strikes was landed by Yan. So, even though Yan didn‚Äôt really land a ton of shots‚ÄîHe still easily oustruck Aljo and never really took significant damage, apart from those two knees. I would say that Sterling is something like an ‚Äúaverage striker‚Äù relative to other Fighters.  
**Vs Sandhagen:** Cory won the first round by being a little more active/successful with his strikes, in the second-I think Yan definitely won the round but Cory did some good work; But after that‚ÄîYan clearly won every round, did way more damage than Cory ever did, and I think the 4th *could* have been scored a 10-8 for Yan, and the 3rd *wasn‚Äôt that far* from being a 10-8 for Yan. 
Imho, Cory is probably one of the 10 Best Strikers in MMA. 

Ultimately, I decided that based on their Resumes:  
Yan has done better with his Striking, against comparable-if not-better Strikers‚Äîthan Izzy has. Therefore, although Izzy might be the better ‚ÄúAll Around Striker‚Äù when it comes to technique and Kickboxing ‚Ä¶ Yan can be considered the ‚ÄúGreater MMA Striker‚Äù.",0.53,7.0,t3_qk0fwz,,

MMA,LET'S PLAY MATCHMAKER: UFC 267,"Good evening America, Good night Dubai, and Happy Halloween morning Oceania! The UFC blessed us with a free numbered for the first time since 2011, and boy did it deliver. An inspiring main event, a hell of a co-main event, and several statements were made across several hours of action. And now, IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT's TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME! to make some fights after UFC 267 gave us so much to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

QUICK ROUND

* Andre Petroski should fight Deron Winn next.
* A Lerone Murphy-Zubaira Tukhugov rematch isn't out of the equation.
* Michal Oleksiejczyk-Alonzo Menifield is a really good one.
* Elizeu Zaleski isn't done yet; Kevin Lee fits into his path.
* Benoit Saint Denis has everyone's respect after what happened today. He should obviously rest, and return sometime in the late spring against someone like Dhiego Lima.
* Albert Duraev has his flaws, but his potential is incredible. Give him Karl Roberson.
* Amanda Ribas has earned the opportunity to take another step up the uber-competitve straw weight latter. Give her Tecia Torres.

MAIN CARD

&amp;#x200B;

* Magomed Ankalaev vs Volkan Oezdemir

RESULT: Magomed Ankalaev defeats Volkan Oezdemir via unanimous decision

Magomed Ankalaev: Anthony Smith or Thiago Santos

Volkan Oezdemir: Winner of Jim Crute-Jamahal Hill

Dagestan's premier light heavyweight, Magomed Ankalaev extends his winning streak to 7 with a win over Switzerland's Volkan Oezdemir. Ankalaev has become a ominous presence in the light heavyweight division, and it may not be too much longer before he gets a title shot. Above him are Anthony Smith, and Thiago Santos, both of which are currently in the win column and searching for another opportunity at UFC gold. Ankalaev's threat of a knockout, as well as his Dagestani-bred wrestling make him the 205 boogeyman. Switzerland's Volkan Oezdemir is 2-5 in his last seven fights. He was outclassed by Magomed Ankalaev on the feet so much to the point where he had to shoot for takedowns on him. Volkan had a three fight losing streak a couple of years ago, and he is at risk of getting another three fight skid. A good next fight for him is to face the winner of Jim Crute-Jamahal Hill which is going down in December. Australia's Crute has powerful hands, and incredible grappling. To put his grappling into perspective, he submitted Paul Craig. He's that good. Michigan's Jamahal Hill is a terrific talent with well-honed striking. Either man would make a banger against Volkan.

&amp;#x200B;

* Li Jingliang vs Khamzat Chimaev

RESULT: Khamzat Chimaev defeats Li Jingliang in Round 1 via technical submission

Khamzat Chimaev: Gilbert Burns, Vicente Luque, Stephen Thompson or Neil Magny

Li Jingliang: Shavkat Rakhmanov, Tim Means, or Alex Morono

Khamzat Chimaev is everything we were hoping for. Chimaev walked through Li Jingliang the same way he walked through his first three opponents. Borzmania is back in full swing, as Chimaev improves to 10-0 and keeping his finish rate at 100%. Since the hype is back for Khamzat, it wouldn't surprise me to see the UFC give him another lucrative booking against a high-end fighter such as Gilbert Burns, Vicente Luque, or Stephen Thompson. Chimaev is clearly capable of finishing both of those fighters, and wins over them would really fuel the demand for a title shot. But if those options are off the table, then Chimaev could still fight the long, rangy, and vastly experienced Neil Magny. Chimaev and Magny traded barbs on social media this past year, so there's already a seed planted for this matchup. You'd best believe that Khamzat Chimaev has the UFC's welterweight division on notice. As for the Leech, I still see him being ranked after today, but he might have to once again fight outside of the rankings. Shavkat Rakhmanov of Kazakhstan has aced his first two UFC tests, and like Khamzat, he is unbeaten with a 100% finish rate. However, that is another hefty task for Li, and if he loses, it will be his third in his last four, hypothetically. If the UFC wants to keep a high-level Chinese presence in the welterweight division, then an easier fight like Tim Means, or Alex Morono will be good fights for Jingliang at this point of his UFC career.

&amp;#x200B;

* Alexander Volkov vs Marcin Tybura

RESULT: Alexander Volkov defeats Marcin Tybura via unanimous decision

Alexander Volkov: Curtis Blaydes II

Marcin Tybura: Winner of Augusto Sakai-Tai Tuivasa

Alexander Volkov once again bounced back from a major loss with a solid unanimous decision win over Marcin Tybura. With how busy heavyweight is right now, we could see Alexander Volkov rematch Curtis Blaydes at this point. Dana White went on record saying that Blaydes' win over Alexander Volkov in June 2020 was not impressive, despite the amount of times he took Volkov down. Volkov has shown vast improvements on takedown defense shutting down any grappling attempts from a very good wrestler in Marcin Tybura. a Blaydes-Volkov rematch looks very good at this point. Marcin Tybura's renaissance isn't over, and he can get back on track against either Tai Tuivasa or Augusto Sakai, two heavyweights that are fighting in November.

&amp;#x200B;

* Islam Makhachev vs Dan Hooker

RESULT: Islam Makhachev defeats Dan Hooker in Round 1 via submission

Islam Makhachev: Beneil Dariush (title eliminator), or just say fuck it and give him the title shot.

Dan Hooker: Justin Gaethje, or Gregor Gillespie

Islam Makhachev is the best lightweight in the world. Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier might be fighting for the title, but Islam is the man to beat at 155. You've got two paths for Islam: Make a title eliminator with Beneil Dariush, another fighter with an impressive win streak with victories over fighters like Diego Ferreira, and Tony Ferguson. Dariush needs a fight, and it's just a matter of who his next opponent is. Or you decide to give Islam a title shot against the winner of Oliveira-Poirier sometime next year. And I'm here to tell you right now, he'll win that fight. As expected, Dan Hooker came out on the wrong end of this short notice fight, getting submitted in just half a round with a kimura. Still, Dan Hooker added even more respect to his already outstanding Cowboy-esque reputation with the fans. I think that Dan Hooker could fight Justin Gaethje if he loses to Michael Chandler next week. Gaethje-Hooker is a banger of a main event, and if doesn't become fight of the year in 2022, then nothing will. If not Gaethje, then Hooker could face highly touted wrestler Gregor Gillespie, who has made things look relatively easy outside of his loss to Kevin Lee. That's a really intriguing test for Hooker, and if it materializes, it will likely go down sometime in Q1 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

* Petr Yan vs Cory Sandhagen

RESULT: Petr Yan defeats Cory Sandhagen via unanimous decision

Petr Yan: Aljamain Sterling II, or TJ Dillashaw (I anticipate a promotion to undisputed champ)

Cory Sandhagen: Merab Dvalishvili

Vintage Petr Yan was on full display in UFC 267's co-main event. Yan captures UFC gold for the 2nd time in 15 months, becoming the interim champion of the bantamweight division. I personally expect the UFC to promote Yan to champion, and book Yan-Dillashaw for Spring 2022. I don't see Aljo returning until the summer, plus virtually no one wants him as the bantamweight division's champion, so a strip is probably imminent. For Cory Sandhagen, there's nothing but respect I've got for him. He now has two fights in 2021 that could win fight of the year, and make no mistake, he is still a top 4 bantamweight in the world after today. I think Cory Sandhagen's wild striking against Merab Dvalishvili's tremendous toughness would create a fight of the night contender, and plus Merab has earned the chance to move on up the bantamweight division, and with Rob Font and Jose Aldo being booked for December, this matchup makes plenty of sense.

&amp;#x200B;

* Jan Blachowicz vs Glover Teixeira

RESULT: Glover Teixeira defeats Jan Blachowicz in Round 2 via submission

Glover Teixeira: Jiri Prochazka, or Aleksandar Rakic

Jan Blachowicz: Anthony Smith

Glover. You crazy mother fucker you actually did it. Glover Teixeira has captured the UFC's light heavyweight championship at the age of 42. That makes him the second fighter in UFC history to capture gold past the age of 40 (Randy Couture did it first in 2007). Now that Glover has pulled off what many called was the impossible, he's got some killers waiting in the wings. Jiri Prochazka is a straight killer, and he's a fighter that everyone wants to see fight for the title. I am intrigued to see how Glover's power matches up against Jiri's seemingly indestructible chin. Jiri is a more one dimensional fighter than Jan, as the Czech fighter doesn't possess as good of a ground game as Blachowicz, but every moment on the feet against Glover will be heart-pounding. Jan Blachowicz was the underdog in his fights against Luke Rockhold, Corey Anderson, Dominick Reyes, and Israel Adesanya. So naturally, the oddsmakers overcorrected giving Blachowicz -300 on the money line. If Jan stays at +200 for the rest of his career then he will not lose for the rest of his career. But all jokes aside, it truly sucks to see Jan lose his title after just one defense. Jan can get back on track against Anthony Smith, a man who has rolled past his last three opponents. Blachowicz-Smith is an amazing matchup, and even though I suggested Smith for Ankalaev, a battle with Blachowicz is much better for him.

MMA,Ranking the top 10 UFC lightweights by how ridiculous they are,"Ranking the top 10 UFC lightweights by how ridiculous they are

A little while ago I ranked the top 10 UFC middleweights by how insane they are and after some heartwarming feedback I have decided to take a look at the top 10 UFC lightweights. After some reflection I thought insane was a more of a middleweight thing, but the lightweights have their own thing going for them. In their own ways they are all goddamn ridiculous. They are either ruthlessly savage, unbelievably misbehaved or just generally ludicrous. Here is my list, feel free to discuss below. 

* C. Tony Ferguson

If you thought anyone else was going to take out the championship of the most ridiculous fighter in the most ridiculous division you were kidding yourself. Sure, Tony‚Äôs aura might have taken a hit from his recent skid in the L column but in case you forgot lets run through a few facts. 

* The man broke former champion and Wheaties Box boy Anthony Pettis in just two rounds after getting back in the cage months faster than predicted after rehabbing his own knee after a very serious surgery he needed after tearing the shit out said knee because he tripped over a cable while doing TV media before his highly anticipated match with Khabib. 
* Tony, he‚Äôs a maniac. He trains like no-one I've ever seen before. On his feet, on the ground. He‚Äôs pulling guard, he‚Äôs doing gymnastics, he‚Äôs doing flips. He‚Äôs into wing-chun. Up in Big Bear he built everything, the bags, the stands. Dude, like he‚Äôs the ultimate MacGyver, uh construction, carpenter. 
* He knocked out every opponent in his path to become The Ultimate Fighter.
* He threatened to ankle pick former heavyweight champion Fabricio Werdum for talking loud in his vicinity. 
* He is your hurricane, your fire in the sun. 
* He touched Kevin Lee‚Äôs staph and didn‚Äôt die. 
* This image exists. (https://imgur.com/a/v88ib7U)
* That isn‚Äôt even mentioning creating his own Twitter language, his training methods or gym stories. Man is arguably the most ridiculous man to ever step in the cage. 

1. Conor McGregor - 
Okay, big picture Conor could be more ridiculous than Tony. If you think he should be higher, I can totally see that. In the span of a decade he went from living off the dole and being a very shit plumber to being one of the most recognisable, famous and well paid athletes in the world. Very ridiculous if you ask me. Then his run as Mystic Mac through to double champ status was a meteoric rise never before seen in MMA. For a lot of longtime fans it was one of the most entertaining periods in MMA history. Then you have the ridiculous Mayweather fight and the even more ridiculous Khabib rivalry. Christ, the man heard his friend and training partner was being intimidated by a rival so he got on a private jet, committed a felony spawned what came to be known as GOOFCON in what might have been the wildest week in MMA history. Ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous. Arguably the one of the most ridiculous things he ever did was get his leg snapped in two fighting Dustin Poirer. Every other time we have seen that happen to a person in any sport they instantly go into shock, and either go dead silent or scream in pain. McGregor did neither and started arguing with the referees, instructed Bruce Buffer that it was a ‚ÄúDOCTOR STOPPAGE, NOT A TKO‚Äù and that Dustin‚Äôs wife was in his DMs. Absolutely fucking ridiculous. I don‚Äôt endorse or condone it, but goddamn it's ridiculous. The only reason he isn‚Äôt the champ of ridiculousness is that despite the poor behaviour and wild attitude he appears capable of explanation, whereas there is no way to explain Tony Ferguson. 

2. Rafael Dos Anjos - 
Look at this moustache, ridiculous. https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mma/players/full/2335687.png

3. Charles Oliveira - 
If you told me Charles Oliveria was gonna be champion at lightweight 5 years ago I would have assumed that a private jet containing the top 5 lightweights was hijacked and crashed into another plane containing the top 6 to 10 lightweights in the world. His ascent was not only ridiculously unexpected, but the man also won the title in ridiculous fashion. After absolutely melting against Michael Chandler for a whole round, he seemingly forgets that was the case and returns the favour in even faster and more brutal fashion. It took 10 ridiculous years and 28 ridiculous fights in the UFC to make it to the title, but he did it goddamn it and if that isn‚Äôt ridiculously inspiring I don‚Äôt know what is.  

4. Justin Gaethje - 
The man is a notoriously tough and aggressive fighter and I know that is what you expected me to talk about. But no, Justin is a man who also says some ridiculous stuff from time to time. He might not have coined it but he did popularise the phrase ‚ÄúIf one man can hold you down, two can rape you.‚Äù Sadly Khabib would indeed hold him down and rather than raping him infront of his parents in Abu Dahbi he opted to just triangle choke him. Admittedly to the untrained eye the difference between the two can be hard to tell. 

5. Michael Chandler - 
The former face of Bellator, Michael Chandler has found himself in some ridiculous scraps and situations. Look, I know a monopoly is not great for the sport of MMA and while the UFC is a massive global organisation we have a duty as fans to spread the love, attention and focus to other organisations for the good of the sport. In saying that, holy shit Bellator is a ridiculous organisation at times and Chandler has been at the coal face of ridiculousness. One ridiculous situation was losing the Bellator Lightweight Championship, then losing a fight for the interim Lightweight Championship, then losing a fight for the vacant Lightweight Championship in the space of a year. Man went 0-3 in title fights in the SAME DIVISION. Man might have Dana White Privilege now, but he has always been treated preferentially. Another ridiculous moment was his loss to Brent Primus in arguably in the top 2 worst calf-kick stanky leg performances next to Jimmy Crute we have ever seen. Mans leg had less structural integrity than a Jon Jones apology, and was floppier than Jon Jones‚Äô cock the night before he needed to apologise. 

6. Dan Hooker - 
While he has fallen short of a title shot in the past, Hooker always seems only one or two fights from breaking through as a title contender at lightweight. While he doesn‚Äôt go as far as Tony in his mentality, middleweight champion Israel Adesanya has called him a psychopath and that has to count for something. He also said wants to see Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (5 foot flat, worth 100k at most) fight Francis Ngannou, and had over 20 interactions with the police while training for his last fight due to lockdowns in NZ. He also took a fight against Islam Makachev on 6 weeks notice and bascially exiled himself from his home country for the foreseeable future. If you saw him fight Dustin Poirier or Edson Barboza you know to believe him when he said his mentality used to be ‚ÄúI want to prove I‚Äôm the toughest man in the world.‚Äù Ridiculous. 

7. Dustin Poirier - 
They don‚Äôt call this man The Diamond because he is gorgeous, worth or a lot of money, or because he takes the center of the ring. It is because of nominative determinism. Dustin went from a brash, emotional, chip on his shoulder newcomer who was tough as nails and trained his body into the ground. Over time the pressure has forged Dustin into The Diamond, an unbreakable man capable of shining brightest under the most intense of lights. We aren‚Äôt sure if he refracts lasers, or would make for a good dentist drill bit, but his climb from juvie and alcoholism to building a better future for Lafayette through the power in his hands is a ridiculous story.

8. Beneil Dariush - 
Sadly the list is becoming slightly less ridiculous now, but don‚Äôt be fooled by his dad-ish good looks, Benny GADOOSH still has plenty to offer in terms of ridiculous. Take his fight with Drakkar Klose. In a comeback and brawl that would make Chan Sung Jung proud Benny simply refused to lose to a man with an even more wild sounding name than him and sent Drakkar to the shadow realm. Watch it unfold here: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=183650993513285

9. Islam Makhachev - 
If you watch Uncle Chael on YouTube you will be forgiven for calling him ‚ÄúIz-lamb Mockle-chev‚Äù. The most ridiculous thing about Makhachev is his manager Ali Abdelaziz, and the fact that he was neighbors with and has known Hasbullah for 10 years. Way to be in on the meme first dude. 

10. Gregor Gillespie - 
What the fuck? Gregor Gillespie is a top 10 Lightweight in the UFC? Technically his last win at Lightweight was January 2019 against Yancy Medeiros (who was cut back in August) because his last fight was at Catchweight, and the fight before that Kevin Lee knocked him out in ridiculous fashion. I don't mean to talk shit, but he caught be way off guard. 

* Honourable Mention: Khabib Nurmagomedov - 
If he was still fighting and ranked Khabib would probably be top 3 for:
* Doing all his shittalking in the cage while he is trying to rip your arm off
* For wrestling a bear as a child
* For being your paradise and angel up above
* For being the pilot for the first and only Air Dagestan flight from inside the Octagon to a few meters outside of it. Man, what a fucking wild night. If anyone has the unedited broadcast footage from the night let me know for posterity. This is the best I could find: https://youtu.be/1SP6-X2YUxA

MMA,An amateurs take on this Khamzat Chimaev vs Li Jinglang fight and some things to look out for,"So a lot is being made of this weight cut of Khamzat Chimaev and what it means for him and honestly, I'd be lying if I said it didn't matter. Khamzat Chimaev is coming off of a long layoff where he was in terrible shape because of COVID and how devastating the affects of it were on him. He was really messed up. So a shakey weight cut after a serious health scare and a history of normally not struggling to make weight even on short notice (famously fighting twice in two weeks) isn't really a good sign. It's not neccesarily a death sentence, but it's something to keep in mind. 






Now, addressing this fight under the assumption that everything is fine and both guys are at their best, it's still pretty interesting. I've seen every Khamzat fight he's had in the UFC and they've all been dominant, but they all come with the a caveat.







Ignoring that Gerald fight where he freaked out and ran himself onto the fence before getting knocked out (he really Meerschat the bed on that one, huh?), Khamzat's fights have consisted of him pressuring his opponents and scoring takedowns. His ground game is actually super neat and fun. Lots of Dagestani handcuffs (grabbing at the wrist to break your opponent down) and lots of work from top positions. He's a real blast to watch work. But he hasn't really shown the ability to take people down in a very intelligent way. 







Let me explain what I mean: most succesful elite grapplers when faced with a challenge know of ways to get into a position to shoot, mostly via boxing their way in or kickboxing their way in or mixing in feints with their striking and using those feints to set up a takedowns or shooting after slipping a strike. Khamzat's found success just by applying pressure to fighters not good enough to avoid folding and shooting essentially naked takedowns, but he really hasn't had to do anything more than that because none of his opponents have presented challenges that would make him do otherwise. 






Enter Li Jinglang.









Li Jinglang isn't someone who applies insurmountable pressure or anything and has been out wrestled in the past, namely by one very experienced Neil Magny. But Li Jinglang has something nobody else has had for Khamzat in the UFC: the man can fucking crack. He's far from infallible, but the man can hit. 






Li Jinglang spent the majority of his first round KO win over Santizo Ponzinibbio fighting from the outside and occasionally darting in but the important thing is that he was comfortable holding his ground from the outside and the only time Santizo really came in, he got put out cold trying to exchange with Li. Not saying that you can't successfully exchange with Li Jinglang, you can win an exchange with anyone in the pocket with varying degrees of difficulty. It's just that Khazmat hasn't demonstrated nor has had the need to demonstrate anything that would show that he can implement his regular gameplan against Jinglang, which is why this fight is so fascinating. We'll have to see what he can do differently to win this fight, if he's ready to do that. 










Now it's MMA and there's every chance that Jinglang meershits the bed on saturday and runs himself onto the fence or the unfortunate possibility that Khamzat's recent healthscare has harmed his potential, but even without those two possibilities, this is shaping up to be a very interesting fight stylistically.












Edit: really didn't expect the first thing Li Jinglang would do in this fight would be to square his hips up and throw a wild overhand at a guy who shoots noticeably in the first minute, but okay. That was certainly a choice.",0.58,16.0,t3_qiqpae,,

MMA,What If? MMA Edition: What if Israel Adesanya was a Contender/Champ facing the previous generation of Middleweights? (circa 2010-2015),"We‚Äôve seen Israel Adesanya practically clear out today‚Äôs middleweight division to the point where he is now rematching previous foes. So what if Izzy was in the UFC‚Äôs middleweight division around 2010-2015 facing the likes of Weidman, Jacare, Rockhold, Mousasi, Anderson, and Machida in their primes. 
Below I give my take on how these match ups might have played out. 

Jacare:
The relentless pressure and heavy hands of Jacare (circa 2014) probably submits or wins a decision a la Blachowiz. I say this because Jacare might have been somewhat of a plodding pressure fighter with heavy hands like Costa, but he was also always taking fools down and submitting them too.

Rockhold:
Izzy probably beats Rockhold in a pure striking affair since we know Rockhold never had a takedown game to complete what was probably 185‚Äôs strongest top game. Rockhold‚Äôs frame might have made this a more interesting matchup, but his striking often only relied on two weapons, his left round kick from south paw and his fading right hook for which he was punished by Romero,Blachowiz, and of course Michael Bisping.

Mousasi:
Izzy probably beats Mousasi in a decent striking showcase since Mousasi has been known to be a jack of all and master of none despite his amazing record, having lost to mostly specialists. (Lovato-Bjj, Jacare-Bjj, Machida-Striking). 
P.S. u/fightsgoneby didn‚Äôt make me write this.

Machida:
Izzy probably has a boring staring contest with Machida which could go either way, but slightly favoring Izzy due to his height and reach.

Weidman:
Weidman is a tough one, he had quite a chin on him and his pressure fighting and takedown game were seamless during his time as champ. He was never a power puncher or submission artist but I do think he might have been able to grind out a decision against Izzy through consistent takedowns and crowding him out on the feet. I also think the IV bans affected Weidman, he came in a lot smaller in his fights after USADA banned IV‚Äôs to rehydrate.

Anderson:
Izzy vs Anderson probably goes similar to their fight in 2016 but likely a lot closer or with Anderson winning a razor thin decision due to the fact that he wouldn‚Äôt have been 40 years old then and the gamesmanship factor of the old Anderson might have made this fun.

This is the interview from yesterday of the Leech with my interpretation in English.

**Question:** What are your initial thoughts on Khamzat Chimaev as an opponent ahead of your fight on Saturday?

Li: First of all thank you to all the media members interviewing me. You have worked hard. I'm very happy to be back again at fight island. Because fight island and my homeland XinJiang (province in China) are very similar. I like being back again. Fighting. 

Where I'm from it's just like you see it in those documentaries. I was born in the countryside. I liked farming. The sun and sweat. 

**Question:** Are you impressed with his skills (Khamzat) over three fights in the UFC?

Li: There is no way he doesn't know me. Whether or not he knows me no matter. The important thing is I know him. He's very well known. Only three fights and he already got the attention of the media. The attention of the UFC fans. The attention of UFC. And I watched his fights. But, I still believe in me, even when other people don't. But no matter. When it comes time Saturday, this (gestures to fist) does the talking. 

**Question:** Have you seen anything from him that has impressed you?

Li: Of course! His wrestling and striking have both been impressive. This is what MMA means! Anything can happen. He has stopping power and I have stopping power too. 

**Question:** What has happened in your camp that has allowed you to compete at such a high level at this point in your career?

Li: That's my team. My team allowed me. My coach. My family. My kids. My country. That's why I believe in myself. I will be able to accomplish it. 

**Question:** Have you spotted any weakness?

Li: Of course there is weakness. Everyone has weakness. I have weakness. And I have strengths too. You only see him. But have you seen me? We are the same level we are on the same rank. Only the two of us are in the cage fighting. So we are basically the same. If he didn't have a good opponent, would this fight have been set up? As long as I prepare myself, I will always win. He isn't the only one that is hungry. I am thirsty too. And I want to drink some blood. 

**Question:** We were in here earlier and he said he was going to eat you and take your head. I would like your reaction to that.

Li: Ok. Welcome. Come on. Who eat who. Hasn't been determined yet. The blood sucking demon vs the wolf man. Can't wait. Come on baby let's go! 

**Question:** What makes Khamzat so dangerous? And what is your best weapon to beat him? 

Li: I think whether or not someone is dangerous depends on their confidence. Everyone needs to give themselves confidence. Especially if we are men. Especially for this sport MMA. You got to be even more confident. I believe it is like this. He is confident. Of course I am even more confident. After so many wars, so much experience has given me many opportunities to learn both from victory and defeat. Whether it is my body or my age I feel great. 

Li: Thank you every media member. You worked hard.",0.94,155.0,t3_qhwkiy,,

MMA,What would fighter pay look like if they received a larger revenue percentage?,"There's a lot of talk about how the UFC should pay fighters 30-40%, so let's break down what those numbers look like. FYI, I'm excluding the women's featherweight division because there are only 3 full-time fighters there; it's not a proper division.

So, that leaves 11 divisions, which means 11 champions. 11 #1 contenders, 44 people that make up #2-5, another 55 from #6-10 and 55 from #11-15. There are perhaps 700 fighters on the roster, which means that 76% of fighters are unranked, adding up to 535 people.  For the sake of our calculations, let's say that the champ and top 5 fight roughly twice per year while everyone else fights three times.  Here's what you could pay each bracket, with an individual fighter's earnings on the left and the total amount for the collective on the right, with activity factored in (so 11 champions x $3m per performance = $33m x two fights per year = $66m):

Champ- $3m ($66m)

\#1 contender- $1m ($22m)

\#2-5- $600k ($52m)

\#6-10- $400k ($66m)

\#11-15- $200k ($33m)

Starting wage for joining the UFC- $30k, with an unranked average wage of $80k ($128m)

This would all add up to $367 million dollars, or 36% of annual revenue (based on the UFC being on track to top $1 billion this year). Now bonuses.  Let's say that 7 fighters deserve a bonus per event, if we go by audience feedback after each Saturday.  Bump up bonuses to $100k for every KO, submission, FOTN, even co-FOTN for those that deserve recognition. As well as monthly awards for best KO, submission and FOTN along with an annual award for those categories, all $100k (meaning that you can earn $300k for your performance on the night, monthly and 'of the year', separate to your show money). Bonuses then reach a total of $33m for the year.

When you combine fighter pay and bonuses, you'll get $400m or 40% of revenue for fighters.

For a comparison with what they're being paid now, the starting wage is $12k, top 10 fighters can headline events while earning less than $100k and champions themselves can make as little as $100k to show, as Zhang Weili proved against Joanna (the Chinese broadcaster for that event earned $57.5m from subscribers).",0.92,441.0,t3_qzril8,2021-11-22 13:02:53,

MMA,Ranked fighters who have not defeated another currently ranked fighter,"Ranked fighters who have not defeated another currently ranked fighter within their division

Limited this to 1) top 10 ranked fighters, 2) only considering wins over other currently ranked fighters in their division, 3) only considering fights in their current division, and 4) only UFC fights.

~~Kelvin Gastelum~~ (beat Uriah at MW in TUF final, then became a WW, now MW)  
Colby Covington  
Jorge Masvidal (beat Chiesa at 155)  
Belal Muhammad  
Dan Hooker

EDIT: Yes, we can argue about the criteria, etc. My goal was to encourage discussion &amp; thought about the rankings and fighters.  
EDIT: thanks for the corrections - I've updated  
EDIT: limited to top 10 because many get to 14-15 by beating unranked fighters; others at 11-15 have beaten those who recently fallen out of ranking  or are fighters aging out; 11-15 are generally less relevant anyway   
EDIT: noted Masvidal-Chiesa at LW &amp; Gastelum-Maia at TUF MW

MMA,How UFC landscape would look like with a 165 lb division,"I was listening to the ""Weighing In"" podcast the other day and at some point Josh and Big John were discussing how UFC would be impacted with a 165 lb division. Josh argued divisions would get shallowed whereas Big John said it would be good for the UFC.

It made me think how a good reshuffle would actually look like and I was a bit surprised with how interesting things would get.

For this exercise, I used the divisions that would be impacted the most (featherweight up to middleweight) and selected the top guys for each one (in bold you can see new guys at a division with the obvious exception of 165 where everybody is new).

 

**Featherweight**

Alex Volkanovski (C)

Brian Ortega

Yair Rodriguez

Korean Zombie

Giga Chikadze

Edson Barboza

Dan Hooker

**Henry Cejudo**

&amp;#x200B;

The 145 division would not be impacted too much by these. Yair is back and looked great against back, Giga is promising and 1 extra division could allow the return of Henry Cejudo at Featherweight. The question marks would be Dan Hooker and Edson Barbosa who could realistically move between 145 and 155 and choose the one with potential higher returns. Still, even without Max, this division looks solid 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lightweight**

Charles Oliveira (C)

Islam Makhachev

Justin Gaethje

Beneil Dariush

Tony Ferguson

Rafael dos Anjos

Arman Tsarukyan

**Max Holloway**

&amp;#x200B;

The big addition to the division would be Max. I think that regardless of the outcome of a likely Max v Volk 3, he should move up. He showed against Dustin he can be competitive against top 155s and he probably just needs time to ""fill his frame"" and get ready to contend. Justin, Charles, Islam and Beneil can keep the top interesting and who knows....maybe UFC can look at Pitbull and AJ McKee as additions to this division.

&amp;#x200B;

**The new 165 lb division**

Colby Covington

Dustin Poirier

Conor McGregor

Michael Chandler

Gilbert Burns

Nate Diaz

Jorge Masvidal

Michael Chiesa

Sean Brady

Kevin Lee

&amp;#x200B;

All I can see is wow, this division would be the prime division in the UFC. Not only it would feature some of the best, but it would also have the flashiest and brashest fighters in UFC. Allow me to explain the criteria:

* Dustin and Conor have said they don't want to cut weight; with a new division, they wouldn't have to and all of a sudden Conor would be up for a more valid title challenge.
* A bit like the Max/Volk situation, Colby might be the obvious #2 of the division but not good enough to be the champion; with this new division he could become champion but above all he would have great potential matchups in Conor, Dustin and Jorge
* If Nate resigns he can cut less weight for 165 and sort of have a clean slate. He won't be a top contender but he can still have fun fights
* I feel like Michael Chandler style would fit this division - he also possesses a stocky frame - but he could move between 155 and 165.
* Sean Brady would be the new challenger that could surprise some.
* Kevin Lee is bound to disappoint but some of his problems are due to weight. 170s can take him down with ease and he has problems going down to 155; a new division would also allow me to start fresh and who knows...maybe get a fun fight with a top contender

&amp;#x200B;

**Welterweight (175)**

Kamaru Usman (C)

Leon Edwards

Khamzat Chimaev

Darren Till

Vincent Luque

Stephen Thompson

Kevin Holland

Michel Pereira

**Kelvin Gastelum**

&amp;#x200B;

This division wouldn't change much but it would be interesting to see how a 5-lb shift would impact things. I think Kamaru and Chimaev would benefit from not cutting so much weight, but beyond those 2, Darren Till, Kevin Holland and the returning Kelvin Gastelum would find the right (weight-cutting) spot between 170 and 185 and could make things interesting..

&amp;#x200B;

**Middleweight (190)**

Israel Adesanya (C)

Robert Whittaker

Paulo Costa

Marvin Vettori

Jared Cannonier

Derek Brunson

Jack Hermansson

**Thiago Santos**

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do at MW? Do we keep it 185 or do we increase it to 190 to shorten the gap between MW and LHW to 15lb? I'd like the latter in order to 1) test Adesanya further before a move to LHW 2) allow Paulo Costa to keep fighting at MW and 3) allow people like Thiago Santos to move. Robert Whittaker would be the wild card here because he also fought at welterweight in the past. With a new 175-lb limit at WW, he may be keen to move back if he loses against Adesanya again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what did I learn after doing this exercise?

* Adding 165 and adjusting divisions would bring fresh, interesting new challenges
* Different divisions would be able to cope with departure
* We'd have a new title (more 5-round fights, more interest in PPV)
* Some fighters could kick-start their career in the division

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.
